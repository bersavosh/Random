# Files that help with Xspec/PyXspec/BXA analysis:

- pyxspec_notebook.ipynb: A simple example for using PyXspec.
- tclex.tcl: An example of TCL script for Xspec. Not mine, probably grabbed it from [Xspec's guide](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/XSappendixTcl.html).
- xspec_plot_commands.dat: Some simple pgplot commands to make Xspec plots look slightly better.
- pgplot_colors.gif: Color designations in PgPlot (and thus Xspec)

More to be added later...
